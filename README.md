# LED Me Know

LED Me Know is a little library which can be used to control an LED matrix or strip connected to a board. Paired with a custom reporter, you can display the results of your tests on a strip of LEDs. It will _led you know_ when your tests have passed or failed. For a more detailed description on the setup, [checkout the blog post.](http://blog.johnnycopperstone.me/led-me-know)

### Reporters

Creating a custom reporter for a test framework is pretty simple using this library. Check out the [api documentation](docs/) for more information. If you create a reporter for a framework not listed below, please PR the addition in the list below, to keep an up to date reference of all the reporters using `led-me-know`.
